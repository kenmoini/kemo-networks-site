## Hello and welcome.

This is the **semi-unprofessional** home for random things and shitposting.

The content here is usually related to technology, but far from limited to it.  It's going to have a smattering of words you've not heard often, and densely peppered with flavorful language that some may not like hearing all the time - if you have more than a 5th grade comprehension and can handle reading curse words without having a mental break down then great, if not then please get the fuck off of here and back to Twitter.

## Why Kemo **Networks** though?

At first the idea was to have some sort of something here...the domain still services a couple of my labs, but DNS and other services are resolved and handled internally so I didn't really need the domain I suppose.

The thing is, you get attached to domains and this has my handle to it and it's kinda catchy.  Maybe one day I'll figure out some amaze-balls service to offer here, or a platform for techno-babble, but until that day I'll just post random things on here.

I don't do the whole social media thing, but I come across some pretty cool shit in my day to day that's often not worth sharing but I feel compelled to do so anyway.  I'm primarily thinking photos of funny shit I see, but other bits and bobs will probably be aggrigated here.

OH!  Also, this is where I'll post my #100DaysOfCode challenge.  Figured it a better place than spamming across my personal portfolio that's got a bit more polish (or I like to think it does).
