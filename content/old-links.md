There's not much to explain here, it's very much just a link list.  There are some bookmark/link listing+service out there but that's just another account to get compromised so why bother when I can edit and serve basic HTML like any half-brained bozo...everyone thought it was hot shit back when Xanga and MySpace were a thing.
